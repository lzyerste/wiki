# p4-clockmod

This driver implements a scaling driver with an internal governor for Intel Core (Sandy Bridge and newer) processors.: CPUFreq driver for Intel Pentium 4/Xeon/Celeron processors which lowers the CPU temperature by skipping clocks. (You probably want to use a SpeedStep driver instead.)
