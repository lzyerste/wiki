```
Another head hang slowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence caused such silence
Who are we mistaken
But You see it's not me,
It s not my family
In your head,in your head
They are fighting
With their tanks, and their bombs
And their bombs, and their guns
In your head
In your head they are crying
In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie
Another mother's breaking
Heart is taking over
When the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken
It's the same old theme since 1916
In your head,
In your head they're still fighting
With their tanks ,and their bombs
And their bombs, and their guns
In your head
In your head they are dying
In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie
