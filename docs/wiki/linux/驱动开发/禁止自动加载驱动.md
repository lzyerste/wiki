# 禁止自动加载驱动

修改文件`/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf`，往里面添加，注意加关键词blacklist
    
```bash
$ tail /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf             
# ugly and loud noise, getting on everyone's nerves; this should be done by a
# nice pulseaudio bing (Ubuntu: #77010)
blacklist pcspkr

# EDAC driver for amd76x clashes with the agp driver preventing the aperture
# from being initialised (Ubuntu: #297750). Blacklist so that the driver
# continues to build and is installable for the few cases where its
# really needed.
blacklist amd76x_edac
blacklist nvme
```
