# MAX_NR_ZONES

url: https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/linux/mmzone.h#L345
说明: ZONE类型数

编译时动态生成文件include/generated/bounds.h

```python
#define MAX_NR_ZONES 5 /* __MAX_NR_ZONES */

// 我本地机器生成的是5：ZONE_DMA, ZONE_DMA32, ZONE_NORMAL, ZONE_MOVABLE, ZONE_DEVICE
// 因为是64位机器，所以ZONE_HIGHMEM没有了。
```

```python
// https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/linux/mmzone.h#L345

enum zone_type {
	/*
	 * ZONE_DMA and ZONE_DMA32 are used when there are peripherals not able
	 * to DMA to all of the addressable memory (ZONE_NORMAL).
	 * On architectures where this area covers the whole 32 bit address
	 * space ZONE_DMA32 is used. ZONE_DMA is left for the ones with smaller
	 * DMA addressing constraints. This distinction is important as a 32bit
	 * DMA mask is assumed when ZONE_DMA32 is defined. Some 64-bit
	 * platforms may need both zones as they support peripherals with
	 * different DMA addressing limitations.
	 *
	 * Some examples:
	 *
	 *  - i386 and x86_64 have a fixed 16M ZONE_DMA and ZONE_DMA32 for the
	 *    rest of the lower 4G.
	 *
	 *  - arm only uses ZONE_DMA, the size, up to 4G, may vary depending on
	 *    the specific device.
	 *
	 *  - arm64 has a fixed 1G ZONE_DMA and ZONE_DMA32 for the rest of the
	 *    lower 4G.
	 *
	 *  - powerpc only uses ZONE_DMA, the size, up to 2G, may vary
	 *    depending on the specific device.
	 *
	 *  - s390 uses ZONE_DMA fixed to the lower 2G.
	 *
	 *  - ia64 and riscv only use ZONE_DMA32.
	 *
	 *  - parisc uses neither.
