```python
See Documentation/core-api/xarray.rst for how to use the XArray.
```

```python
/**
 * struct xarray - The anchor of the XArray.
 * @xa_lock: Lock that protects the contents of the XArray.
 *
 * To use the xarray, define it statically or embed it in your data structure.
 * It is a very small data structure, so it does not usually make sense to
 * allocate it separately and keep a pointer to it in your data structure.
 *
 * You may use the xa_lock to protect your own data structures as well.
 */
/*
 * If all of the entries in the array are NULL, @xa_head is a NULL pointer.
 * If the only non-NULL entry in the array is at index 0, @xa_head is that
 * entry.  If any other entry in the array is non-NULL, @xa_head points
 * to an @xa_node.
 */
struct xarray {
	spinlock_t	xa_lock;
/* private: The rest of the data structure is not to be used directly. */
	gfp_t		xa_flags;
	void __rcu *	xa_head;
};
