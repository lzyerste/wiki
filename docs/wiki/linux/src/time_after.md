```c
/*
 *	These inlines deal with timer wrapping correctly. You are 
 *	strongly encouraged to use them
 *	1. Because people otherwise forget
 *	2. Because if the timer wrap changes in future you won't have to
 *	   alter your driver code.
 *
 * time_after(a,b) returns true if the time a is after time b.
 *
 * Do this with "<0" and ">=0" to only test the sign of the result. A
 * good compiler would generate better code (and a really good compiler
 * wouldn't care). Gcc is currently neither.
